Here I am analyzing the logs. The 1st part contains code for storing the workpieces in the storage. But the "All part" contains code for **all the tasks e.g., storing and removing**
The storage is shown using a table.

The working files are present in `All part/table2.py` and the `All part/test-combined.txt` file.
